## Introduction

This document describes the Cast Companion Library for Android (CCL). Throughout the
document, there may be references to the [Cast Video application](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android)
that is built using the CCL to show how the library can be used in a practical example.

CCL is written with the following objectives in mind:
- To provide a wrapper around the Cast SDK and related Google Play Services to
hide the mundane tasks that are needed for casting.
- To provide a collection of ready-to-use Cast-related components and features
that are strongly recommended by the UX Guidelines.
- To provide an example of how the Cast SDK can be used to accomplish more
complex tasks.

Since playing media is a common use case on a Chromecast device, CCL provides extensive
support for casting and managing media content. In addition, it supports applications that are
strictly using custom data channels.

Here is a collection of features that CCL provides for media-centric applications:
- Wrapper for device discovery
- Customized notification
- Customized Cast Menu (Media Router controller dialog)
- Lock Screen remote control via `MediaSessionCompat` and `NotificationCompat.MediaStyle`
- Player Control while casting
- Global access via Mini-Controller
- Pain-free session recovery, including the reconnection logic outlined in the UX guideline
- A single custom data channel for sending and receiving custom data
- Ability to check the installed Google Play services for compatibility
- Handling media tracks, including settings page for all versions of Android
- Handling changes to the volume of the cast device using the hard volume button
inside and outside of the app, even on lock screen or when the screen is off

And for data-centric applications:
- Wrapper for device discovery
- Wrappers for registering and using multiple custom data channels
- Pain-free session recovery
- Ability to check the installed Google Play services for compatibility

In the subsequent sections, we will describe how each of these features can be accessed by an
application. In what follows, we use "client" to refer to the application that uses CCL.

## Overall Design

Most of this document focuses on media-centric applications. Toward the end, we come back
and discuss how data-centric apps can use this library.

To maintain the state of the application in regards to connectivity to a Cast device, there needs
to be a central entity that transcends the lifecycles of individual activities in the application. The
CCLâ€™s main component, the `VideoCastManager` is the entity that does that (`DataCastManager` is the
corresponding component for the data-centric use cases).

This class is a singleton that is responsible for managing the majority of the work by...

- Providing a rich set of APIs and callbacks.
- Maintaining the state of the system (such as connectivity to the Cast device, status of the media on
the receiver, etc.).
- Updating various components such as the CCL Notification Service and Mini-Controller.

In order to have a notification that lasts even if the client application is killed (directly by user or
indirectly by the system) while casting, CCL starts a Cast Notification Service.
The [Cast UX guidelines](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ux_guidelines) request
that the system notification for a Cast application to be visible only when the
application is not visible. By providing simple hooks for the client, CCL handles this task as well.

Here is a subset of classes and their main responsibilities that will be discussed in more details
in subsequent sections:

- `BaseCastManager`
  - An abstract class that handles most of the connectivity to a cast device, including the reconnection
	logic.
  - Clients are encouraged to use the two concrete subclasses `VideoCastManager` cand `DataCastManager`,
  but if they need to modify the behavior, they can extend these two concrete classes or implement this
  abstract class directly.

- `VideoCastManager`
  - Specifically designed for video-centric applications, this is a singleton that clients interact with
  directly. It internally uses other classes and components of CCL to manage and maintain the state of a
  video-centric application.

- `VideoCastNotificationService`
  - A local service that allows notifications to appear when needed beyond the availability of the main
  application.

- `MiniController`
  - A compound control that provides a Mini-Controller for the client.

- `VideoCastControllerActivity`
  - Provides a default implementation of the Player Control screen that clients can use with their
  application. Most of the associated logic is defined in the `VideoCastControllerFragment`.

- `DataCastManager`
  - Another concrete subclass of the `BaseCastManager` that is specifically designed for data-centric
  applications.
  - It is a singleton that clients interact with directly and internally uses other classes and
  components of CCL to manage and maintain the state of the data-centric application and provides means
  to register one or more namespaces for data communication between a sender client and a receiver application.

- `ReconnectionService`
  - A background service that handles reconnection logic when wifi connectivity is lost.

The MediaRouter and Cast SDK, in collaboration with the Google Play services, provide a
collection of asynchronous calls that starts with the discovery method and continues to route
selection, device connection, `RemoteMediaPlayer` creation, etc. For each of these asynchronous
calls, there are one or more callbacks that inform the caller of the success or failure of the API
calls and are generally a signal that moving to the next call is now permitted. Not all the
activities or components in a client app are interested in receiving all the callbacks. CCL makes
it easy for client components to only register for a subset of callbacks based on their needs.
Although most of the Cast API calls are made by CCL, clients can still choose to be notified of all
relevant events and callbacks.

### Dependencies and Project Setup

Here is a list of dependencies for CCL:
- android-support-v7-appcompat
- android-support-v7-mediarouter (this has a dependency on android-support-v7- appcompat)
- Google Play Services - the Base and the Cast components.

Since the two support libraries contribute resources as well, you cannot simply satisfy the
dependency by including their jar files; instead you need to import them as library projects in
Eclipse or in AAR packaged format in Android Studio.

Your client project then needs to list CCL as its only dependency for Cast related functionalities.
In other words, your client application does not need to directly import or declare a dependency
on the support libraries that are mentioned above since CCL brings those dependencies along.

Since Cast APIs are mainly provided by the Google Play Services, the CCL library provides a
convenient static method that all client applications should call at their startup to verify that a
compatible version of the Google Play Services is available on the device. If the Google Play
Services is missing or needs to be updated, a dialog will inform user and direct her to go to the
Play Store to download/update the appropriate version. If, however, the Google Play Services is
installed but is not enabled, it will direct the user to the device settings page to address the
issue. To enable this important validation check, here is a sample code that could calls this
functionality in the `onCreate()` of the launcher Activity of your application:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	BaseCastManager.checkGooglePlayServices(this);
	.....
}
```

## How to Use the Cast Companion Library

In what follows, we will mainly focus on the video-centric applications and use the
`VideoCastManager` but in many cases, the same applies to the `DataCastManager` as well.

### Initializing `VideoCastManager`

The client application needs to instantiate and initialize an instance of `VideoCastManager` as
early as possible. During the initialization step, the client should provide certain information that
CCL needs to perform its tasks. It is recommended that the clients do this step in the `onCreate()`
method of their Application class, so they can easily access it in all activities of the client
applications. The following snippet shows how the [CastVideos-android](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android) reference application
does that:

```java
public void onCreate() {
	super.onCreate();
	VideoCastManager
		.initialize(this, APPLICATION_ID, null, null)
		.enableFeatures(VideoCastManager.FEATURE_NOTIFICATION |
				VideoCastManager.FEATURE_LOCKSCREEN |
				VideoCastManager.FEATURE_WIFI_RECONNECT |
				VideoCastManager.FEATURE_AUTO_RECONNECT |
				VideoCastManager.FEATURE_CAPTIONS_PREFERENCE |
				VideoCastManager.FEATURE_DEBUGGING);
}
```

The static `VideoCastManager.initialize()` method takes four arguments:

1. an (application) Context object

2. an application ID

3. an activity that provides the "Player Control" functionality and
a custom namespace (these will be explained later on). If a client wants CCL to provide its
default Player Control page, the third argument to the `initialize()` should be set to `null`.

4. Finally, the last argument is used when there is a need to have a custom data channel; leave
this as `null` if no custom data channel is required. See the section on
[data channel](#single-custom-data-channel) later in this document to see how this can be used.

CCL can provide a number of features that are disabled by default. Immediately following the
initialization, clients should inform the `VideoCastManager` what features they want to enable in
CCL by calling the static `enableFeatures` method.

Currently there are six features that can be turned on:

1. Notifications
2. Lock Screen remote controller
3. Closed Captions
4. WIFI Reconnection
5. Auto Reconnection
6. Logging in the Google Play Services

To specify which features should be enabled, construct an OR-ed expression of
the desired features and pass that to the `enableFeatures` method. Note that all
features are disabled by default.

After this initialization, one can access this singleton instance by calling:

```java
mCastManager = VideoCastManager.getInstance();
```

_**Remark.** In performing certain tasks, CCL needs to have a reference to the Application Context
instance from the client application (for example, to access client resources or system services).
Any action that requires an Activity Context will ask for one from the client in the respective API
call._

### Adding Cast Button to Action Bar/Toolbar

After having `VideoCastManager` set up, the next step is to put the Cast button in the Action Bar or
Toolbar. The assumption here is that your activity is a direct or indirect subclass of
`AppCompatActivity`, from appcompat-v7 library (see the next section for adding
`MediaRouteButton` when your Activity inherits from `FragmentActivity`):

1. Add the following snippet to the xml file that defines your menu:

	```xml
	<item
		android:id="@+id/media_route_menu_item"
		android:title="@string/media_route_menu_title"
		app:actionProviderClass="android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteActionProvider"
		app:showAsAction="always"/>
	```

2. Add the following line to the `onCreateOptionMenu()` of all your activities:

	```java
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
		super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
		getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);
		mCastManager.addMediaRouterButton(menu, R.id.media_route_menu_item);
		return true;
	}
	```

	Note that the method `addMediaRouterButton` returns a pointer to the `MenuItem` that
	represents the Cast button if you need to have access to it.

3. In `onResume()` of your activity, make sure to add the following snippet:

	```java
	mCastManager = VideoCastManager.getInstance();
	mCastManager.incrementUiCounter();
	```

	and in `onPause()`, call:

	```java
	mCastManager.decrementUiCounter();
	```

Now you have a Cast button in your Action Bar and the VideoCastManager will be in charge of
all the required plumbing to provide the appropriate dialogs, etc.

CCL also provides a custom Cast MediaRouter dialog when the client is connected:

![Cast MediaRouter dialog](img/mediarouter_dialog.png)

### Adding MediaRouteButton

If your `Activity` inherits (directly or indirectly) from the `FragmentActivity`, you have an
additional option of using the `MediaRouteButton`. To add that button, add a snippet like the
following to your layout:

```xml
<android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteButton
	android:id="@+id/media_route_button"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	android:mediaRouteTypes="user"
	android:visibility="gone" />
```

Then obtain a reference to this component in your activity and use the CCL library to set it up:

```java
mMediaRouteButton = (MediaRouteButton) findViewById(R.id.media_route_button);
mCastManager.addMediaRouterButton(mMediaRouteButton);
```

For updating the visibility, however, you need to hook into a callback from the
`VideoCastManager`:

```java
mVideoCastConsumer = new VideoCastConsumerImpl() {
	.....
	@Override
	public void onCastAvailabilityChanged(boolean castPresent) {
		mMediaRouteButton.setVisibility(castPresent ? View.VISIBLE : View.INVISIBLE);
	}
	.....
};
```

Make sure that similar to the previous section, you call `incrementUiCounter()` and
`decrementUiCounter()` in your `onResume()` and in `onPause()` of your activity, respectively. In
addition, you would need to obtain and set the initial state of the button when you enter an
activity (the above callback will help you maintain the correct state when there is a change but
		the initial state needs to be set first). To that end, use the following snippet:

```java
mMediaRouteButton.setVisibility(mVideoCasrManager.isRouteAvailable() ? View.VISIBLE : View.INVISIBLE);
```

### Adding Mini-Controller

![Mini-Controller](img/mini_controller.png)

The Mini-Controller is a small persistent component that enables users to quickly see the
content that is playing on the Cast device, perform basic operations on the remote media
(such as play/pause), and provide a way to get back to the Cast Player page (by clicking on
album art). It also provides an extended component to show the "upcoming" item in your queue
if you have a queue with auto-play turned on. The Mini-Controller should be visible if and only if
the remote video is playing.

The CCL provides a compound component for the Mini-Controller that can be added to the
layout XML of your pages. Here is an example:

```xml
<com.google.sample.castcompanionlibrary.widgets.MiniController
	android:id="@+id/miniController"
	android:layout_width="fill_parent"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"
	android:background="@drawable/shadow7"
	app:auto_setup="true"
	android:visibility="gone">
</com.google.sample.castcompanionlibrary.widgets.MiniController>
```

To configure this component, there are two choices:

1. Using `auto_setup="true"`. If you set this xml attribute to true, then no
additional work is required since the library does all the setup and required plumbing.
This is the preferred approach.

2. Manual configuration. If you set `auto_setup="false"` (this is the default value for
this attribute), then the client application needs to register this component so that the
library can manage its visibility, state and content. Additionally, the client application is
responsible for unregistering this component when is not needed. To register this
component with the instance of `VideoCastManager`, add the following lines to your
Activity's `onCreate()`:

	```java
	mMiniController = (MiniController) findViewById(R.id.miniController);
	mCastManager.addMiniController(mMiniController);
	```

	Remember to unregister this component when you are done by adding the following line
	of code to `onDestroy()` for example:

	```java
	mCastManager.removeMiniController(mMiniController);
	```

Whether you use the `auto_setup` feature, or manually register this component, the
`VideoCastManager` handles updating the metadata shown in this component, the status of the
play/pause button, and also the visibility of the whole control (e.g. if you disconnect your client
application from the Cast device, it will hide this component). Note that the play/pause/stop
buttons are drawables that are defined as aliases to the real assets so you can easily customize
them in your application if needed. These aliases can be found in the res/drawable directory of
the CCL and are named as `ic_mini_controller_pause` and similar names for the other two). You
can copy those aliases to your application and change where they should point to.

When you are playing a queue of items and auto-play is on, this component shows an extended
area when an upcoming item starts preloading on the receiver. This extended area is used to
both inform the user of the upcoming item and also to let user control the auto-play behavior by
providing a "play" button (if clicked on, the upcoming item will start playing immediately) or a
"stop" button, to stop the app from proceeding to the next item; in this case, the playback of the
current item will not be changed.

## Notifications

Notifications will be provided for you if you enabled that feature after initializing the
`VideoCastManager`; the flag to do that is: `VideoCastManager.FEATURE_NOTIFICATION`. What
remains to be done is to help CCL discover when the client application is visible (to hide the
notification) and when it is in the background (to show the notification). This can be
accomplished by adding the following line to your `onResume()`:

```java
mCastManager.incrementUiCounter();
```

and the following line to `onPause()` of all your activities:

```java
mCastManager.decrementUiCounter();
```

Note that these lines were also required for adding `MediaRoute` discovery so your activities
should already have these. CCL also handles notifications on different versions of Android and
uses the `NotificationCompat.MediaStyle` internally.

### Lock Screen Controllers and Volume

CCL can provide default lock screen controllers based on the combination of
`NotificationCompat.MediaStyle` and `MediaSessionCompat`. If desired, this feature needs to be
enabled soon after the initialization of the `VideoCastManager` by using the flag
`VideoCastManager.FEATURE_LOCKSCREEN`. When this feature is enabled, a Play/Pause button will
be shown on the lock screen of the Android devices running Jelly Bean or above. On KitKat+
devices, the layout of the lock screen controllers is different and uses a full-screen album art
while on Jelly Bean it is a small version of the album art. CCL also makes sure that on Android
Lollipop and above, the appropriate Lock Screen controllers are added (based on the
`NotificationCompat.MediaStyle`).

In addition, when this feature is enabled, CCL provides the ability for users to control the
(system) volume of the Cast device even if the application is in the background. On KitKat+
devices, it provides that capability even if the screen is off.

### Cast Player Screen

![Cast Player Screen](img/cast_player.png)

If during the initialization of `VideoCastManager` you opted for the default
Cast Player screen, you will get that without any additional settings.

The Cast Player page shows a full screen artwork with some additional metadata
and some controls to manage the playback of the media on a remote device. It is
important to provide a larger size image for your media for the best experience.

If the user clicks on the artwork in the Mini-Controller or notification, a
transition to the Cast Player page will happen automatically. If, however, you
want to start casting from within the client application, the Cast Manager
provides a simple mechanism for you to launch that screen:

```java
mCastManager.startCastControllerActivity(context, mSelectedMedia, position, autoPlay);
```

Here, `mSelectedMedia` is the `MediaInfo` object that represents your desired media that needs to
 casted, `position` (integer) is the starting point of the video and the `autoPlay` (boolean)
signals whether you want to automatically start the remote playback of the media or not.

This component can handle Queues and can also provide controls for navigating through queue items.

_**Remark 1.** To have all the metadata for a movie available when needed, you need to build and
populate an instance of `MediaInfo` (defined in the Cast SDK) to represent a video. The fields
that will be used in various places are:_

- metadata: use an instance of MovieMetadata that is populated with:
  - title
  - sub-title
  - studio
  - images
    - index 0: small size image used for notification, minicontroller and Lock Screen on JB
    - index 1: large image, used on the Cast Player page and Lock Screen on KitKat
contentId (populate this with the URL pointing to the media)
- contentType: e.g. "video/mp4"
- streamType: typically of type `MediaInfo.STREAM_TYPE_BUFFERED`
- MediaTracks: Closed caption and tracks information, if available. See the section
on [Handling Tracks and Closed Captions](#handling-tracks-and-closed-captions) below.

_**Remark 2.** It is very tempting to try to pass around MediaInfo objects from one activity to
another. For example, if user is browsing a catalog and selects a video to be taken to the next
activity that has detailed info on the media, it is ideal to use the MediaInfo that represents the
selected media and pass that to the next activity. Unfortunately, MediaInfo is neither
`Serializable` nor `Parcelable` so you cannot pass that in an intent; however, CCL uses a simple
`Bundle` to wrap the `MediaInfo`, and provides two static utility methods
`Utils.bundleToMediaInfo()` and `Utils.mediaInfoToBundle()` for conversion between the two
types:_

```java
public static Bundle mediaInfoToBundle(MediaInfo info);
public static MediaInfo bundleToMediaInfo(Bundle wrapper);
```

#### Volume Control

CCL provides an easy way for developers to handle remote volume control in their applications.
Inside an activity, one can override `dispatchKeyEvent`:

```java
@Override
public boolean dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent event) {
	return mCastManager.onDispatchVolumeKeyEvent(event, VOLUME_INCREMENT)
			|| super.dispatchKeyEvent(event);
}
```

CCL will then handle the rest, i.e., it enables controlling the cast volume through the hard volume
button on the phone inside that activity and also shows a visual volume bar when casting on
supported versions. If `FEATURE_LOCKSCREEN` was also enabled during the initialization of the
`VideoCastManager`, then CCL handles change of volume through the hard volume even if your
app is not in front, is locked or even if the screen is off. In the above snippet,
`VOLUME_INCREMENT` is a value that you set in your application and you need to also need to
tell CCL about it by calling the following at an early stage, preferably at the initialization time:

```java
mCastManager.setVolumeStep(VOLUME_INCREMENT);
```

The recommended value for `VOLUME_INCREMENT` when targeting a TV is 0.05 and for audio-only
devices is about 0.03.

_**Remark 3.** If you are targeting Android versions ICS and above, you do not need to overwrite
the `dispatchKeyEvent` at all; `MediaSessionCompat` will handle this automatically but if you need
to support GingerBread, then this change is required and only works when app is in the foreground._

## Session Recovery (Reconnection)

To provide a seamless experience for users, we need to support the following scenario:

Assume that a client application is connected to a Cast device. If the user closes the application without
calling an explicit disconnect, and later opens the same application, the client application needs
to try to re-establish the connection to the same device as long as the Cast device is still
running the same session that the user had started/joined earlier. If the system has not yet killed
your application, this does not require any effort. However, if your application has been killed by the
system (or your connectivity was lost because, e.g., you stepped outside of the wifi range),
some work needs to be done.

CCL can handle both of these cases with no effort on the application side. To enable the
automatic session recovery when your app comes to the front, you need to turn the
`VideoCastManager.FEATURE_AUTO_RECONNECT` feature on after initializing the `VideoCastManager`
instance. From that point on, CCL handles the rest. If, for some reason, you want to trigger the
reconnection attempt, you can call the following API provided by CCL:

```java
mCastManager.reconnectSessionIfPossible(timeoutInSeconds);
```

This method makes a best-effort attempt to reconnect to the same device if the same session is
still running. The optional (int) `timeoutInSeconds` limits how long (in seconds) the whole
reconnection effort should be attempted. If the parameter is not present, a 10 second timeout
will be enforced. If the client was not able to establish a connection during this timeout period,
the effort will be stopped.

There are more subtle, yet important, cases that are required to be handled. As an example, the
user starts casting a long video and puts down her phone on the table; the phone goes to sleep
and the wifi radio is turned off by the system. After a while, the user picks up her phone to pause
the movie using the lock screen controls, but since her phone had lost connectivity, she cannot
take any immediate actions. Reconnection logic should handle such scenarios and as soon as
the wifi connectivity is up again, it should try to connect to the same session and make the lock
screen controls operational.

To handle those and other related cases that are explained in the Cast UI Checklist, CCL
manages a long-running service `ReconnectionService` that can monitor the wifi connectivity and
using the persisted connection and media information, tries to reconnect if possible. To enable
the session recovery after recovering wifi connectivity, turn the
`VideoCastManager.FEATURE_WIFI_RECONNECT` feature on. An application developer, however, can
decide that in a specific situation, she doesnâ€™t want the reconnection to happen. The proper way
to handle this is to clear the persisted data by calling
`VideoCastManager.clearPersistedInfo(what)` (or `DataCastManager.clearPersistedInfo(what)`).
The argument "what" can be one or a combination of different values that can restrict what
portion(s) of the persisted information should be cleared. See the JavaDoc for more details.

_**Note.** The long running service `ReconnectionService` will only start if the
`VideoCastManager.FEATURE_WIFI_RECONNECT` has been set after the `VideoCastManager`
initialization and only if a media playback starts._

### Handling Tracks and Closed Captions

Handling tracks can be divided into three areas: API Support, Changing the Style, and UI
Handling.

#### API Support

Cast SDK provides a number of APIs that can be used to define tracks, to associate them with a
media (video) object, to set or update active tracks for a media and to set or update the style for
a text track . The first step is to define a track: the class `MediaTrack` represents a track and
using a builder pattern, on can define one or more tracks:

```java
MediaTrack englishSubtitle = new MediaTrack.Builder(1 /* ID */, MediaTrack.TYPE_TEXT)
		.setName("English Subtitle")
		.setSubtype(MediaTrack.SUBTYPE_SUBTITLE)
		.setContentId("https://some-url/caption_en.vtt")
		.setLanguage("en-US") // language is required for subtitle type but optional otherwise
		.build();
```

Note that the first argument to the Builder is a unique ID that the application (not the SDK)
defines and assigns to a track so that subsequent APIs can refer to this track.

The next step is to add one or more tracks to a video. This should happen before loading the
media; any changes made to the tracks after loading the media will not take effect until the
media is reloaded. To do that, include the tracks when you build your `MediaInfo` object:

```java
MediaInfo mediaInfo = MediaInfo.Builder(url)
		.setStreamType(MediaInfo.STREAM_TYPE_BUFFERED)
		.setContentType(getContentType())
		.setMetadata(getMetadata())
		.setMediaTracks(tracks) /* a list of tracks */
		.build();
```

Then you can load this media and set or update its style. CCL provides the following wrapper methods:

```java
/* Load a media and set its active tracks */
public void loadMedia(MediaInfo media, final long[] activeTracks, boolean autoPlay,
		int position, JSONObject customData);

/* Sets or updates the active tracks for the currently playing media */
public void setActiveTrackIds(long[] trackIds);

/* Sets or updates the style for the current text track */
public void setTextTrackStyle(TextTrackStyle style);

/* Gets the list of active track ids for the currently playing media */
public long[] getActiveTrackIds();
```

#### Changing the Style for Text Tracks

Users should be able to turn the captions on or off and to change the style of text tracks such as
changing the size of the font, or the color of the background for captions. In Android KitKat and
above, captions can be customized through Captions Settings, found under Settings ->
Accessibility. Earlier versions of Android, however, do not have this capability. CCL handles this
by providing custom settings for earlier versions and delegating to the system settings on KitKat
and above. To take advantage of this feature, you first need to enable the support for this
feature when you initialize the `CastVideoManager` and use the flag: `VideoCastManager.FEATURE_CAPTIONS_PREFERENCE`.

Then you can add an entry point into the Captions settings in your own application preferences;
simply add the following snippet to the XML file that defines the preferences in your application
(remember to replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_PACKAGE` with your own package name):

```xml
<PreferenceCategory
  android:title="@string/captions_settings">
  <PreferenceScreen
    android:key="CAPTION_KEY"
		android:title="@string/captions">
		<intent android:action="android.intent.action.VIEW"
      android:targetClass="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.cast.tracks.CaptionsPreferenceActivity"
			android:targetPackage="YOUR_APPLICATION_PACKAGE"/>
	</PreferenceScreen>
</PreferenceCategory>
```

You also need to add the following snippet to the `onResume()` of the `PreferenceActivity` of your
application:

```java
mCastManager.updateCaptionSummary("CAPTION_KEY", preferenceScreen);
```

Note that the string `CAPTION_KEY` in this snippet should match the key used in the XML file
above.

Adding these snippets provides an entry in the applicationâ€™s preferences that allows users to
enable or disable captions and customize the style for all versions of Android. When the user
makes a change in the captions settings, CCL will be notified automatically and will update the
style of caption on the Cast device. In addition, the `VideoCastConsumer` has three callbacks that
applications can listen to if they are interested in being notified of these changes:

```java
public void onTextTrackStyleChanged(TextTrackStyle style);
public void onTextTrackEnabledChanged(boolean isEnabled);
public void onTextTrackLocaleChanged(Locale locale);
```

These parallel the callbacks that are available in Android KitKat+ through the system framework
but CCL also extends them to the earlier versions.

Note that you need to define a certain activity in your manifest if you want to enable this feature;
see the section on [Manifest](#manifest-file).

#### Setting Active Tracks from UI

Users need to have means to see the tracks that are available for media and be able to select
one or more tracks. This is mainly the responsibility of the application but CCL makes it easier
by providing a dialog that shows the available tracks and allows the user to select one or more
tracks for a media. To open this dialog, use the following snippet:

```java
TracksChooserDialog.newInstance(mMediaInfo)
    .show(mFragmentManager /* e.g. getSupportFragmentManager() */,"some_tag");
```

This dialog allows user to select a Text track or an Audio track. Upon making selections, CCL
notifies any component that has registered to receive such information. For a component to do
that, it has to implement the interface `OnTracksSelectedListener` and has to register itself with
the `VideoCastManager` using the following API:

```java
mCastManager.addTracksSelectedListener(OnTracksSelectedListener);
```

and remove itself when no longer interested:

```java
mCastManager.removeTracksSelectedListener(OnTracksSelectedListener);
```

The `TracksChooserDialog` dialog extends `FragmentDialog` (from v4 support library), hence
survives screen rotation and other configuration changes.

The Cast Player Screen also provides an icon that opens this dialog and allows user to select
one or more tracks for the media that is playing on the cast device. Note that tracks support
should be enabled in order for this icon to appear; if the media does not have any tracks, the
icon will be grayed out (but visible) as long as the tracks support has been enabled.

### Queues

Cast SDK provides support for a queue of media items (video or audio). Client applications
should build a queue and then use any of the queue-related APIs that CCL provides to manage
the queue, such as load, update, insert, delete, shuffle, etc. The receiver SDK creates a queue
even if one single item is loaded using the normal load command (vs `queueLoad()`).

CCL provides a number of callbacks to update the clients on changes to the queue, such as
`onMediaQueueUpdated()`. In addition, when you have a queue of video items with adaptive bitrate
(such as a queue of HLS streams), you can take advantage of "preload" feature which
allows you to preload the next video when the the currently playing item finishes downloading;
this allows a much smoother transition from one queue item to the next.

CCL also provides a number of callbacks to inform the application of the preloading event, such as
`onRemoteMediaPreloadStatusUpdated()`.
See [`VideoCastConsumer`](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android/blob/master/src/com/google/android/libraries/cast/companionlibrary/cast/callbacks/VideoCastConsumer.java)
for a complete list of available callbacks.

#### Single Custom Data Channel

For media-centric applications, CCL also provides a single data channel (in addition to the
standard media channel) to enable out-of-bound communication between the sender and
receiver applications. For example, a sender application may need to provide a mechanism for
its users to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down when they are watching a content. These types of
communications require a custom data channel.

To facilitate this, the last argument to the `initialize()` call to initialize the `VideoCastManager`
can be used. You can choose a namespace of your choice and pass that as the last argument
to that call. CCL will then set up the sender part of the data channel and provide a single API
for you to send a message to the receiver (`sendDataMessage()`) and two callbacks:

1. `onDataMessageReceived()` - called when the receiver receives a message
2. `onDataMessageSendFailed()` - called when the send command encounters an error

CCL also provides an API for you to remove your custom data channel (`removeDataChannel()`),
but does the appropriate clean up for you when you disconnect from a device. Refer to the
library's JavaDoc for documentation on these APIs and callbacks. Note that you would need to have a
custom receiver to be able to send and receive messages using your custom namespace.

## Support for data-centric applications

If you are working with an application that is mainly data-centric and needs one or more custom
data channels but no media data channel, you can initialize and use a different class in the
library, the `DataCastManager`. This class is the equivalent of the `VideoCastManager` and
behaves similarly when you are setting it up. The initialization of this singleton is done by calling
the following method:

```java
initialize(Context context, String applicationId, String... namespaces);
```

As is clear from the above, you can register one or more namespaces by appending them as
last arguments of this method. Note that you can add/remove namespaces later on by calling:

```java
addNamespace(String namespace); // to add a new namespace
removeNamespace(String namespace); // to remove
```

The library takes care of setting up the data channel(s) for you. You can then use the following
API to send a message on any of these channel(s):

```java
void sendDataMessage(String message, String namespace)
```

This will send a message. Messages that are sent to the sender from the receiver can be
captured by extending `DataCastConsumerImpl` class and overriding the following callbacks:

```java
public void onMessageReceived(CastDevice castDevice, String namespace, String message);
public void onMessageSendFailed(CastDevice castDevice, String namespace, long messageId, int errorCode);
```

## Hooking into Lifecycle Callbacks

The CCL library tries to handle most common scenarios but it also provides clients with access
to events that can be useful in more advanced cases. For media-centric applications, clients can
implement the `VideoCastConsumer` interface and register the implementation with the
`VideoCastManager` instance. In case of data-centric apps, implement `DataCastConsumer` and
register the implementation with the instance of DataCastManager.

If you refer to the documentation on these interfaces, you will find a long list of callbacks that
range from connectivity success to application launch failure, etc. To make your life easier, the
library introduces two no-op implementations of these interfaces: `VideoCastConsumerImpl` and
`DataCastConsumerImpl`. Consequently, you can extend these classes and ignore all the interface
methods except the ones that you are interested in and only override those methods. For
example, here is how you can extend and register one:

```java
mCastManager.addVideoCastConsumer(new VideoCastConsumerImpl() {
	@Override
	public boolean onApplicationConnectionFailed(int errorCode) {
		// do what your application wants
		return true;
	}
});
```

_**Remark 1.** In order to use the custom data channels properly, you need to implement the
custom data related methods of these interfaces to at least receive messages from the receiver._

_**Remark 2.** Most methods in these two interfaces have no return values. However, there are few
of them that should return a boolean. These methods are related to failures in various stages
(for example "launching application failed"). CCL can provide a standard error dialog for your
application if your implementation of these methods returns true (that is the behavior of the
default implementation classes, as well). If you want to provide your own error dialogs, make
sure you override these methods and return `false`._

_**Remark 3.** All the lifecycle callbacks are called on the Main (i.e. UI) Thread unless stated
otherwise._

## Advanced Topics

### Live Streams

For live streams, the "pause" action should be interpreted somewhat differently. In general, if
user starts playback after a pause in a live stream, player will not resume from the last point but
instead will start from the current time in the live stream (in other words, there is no DVR
functionality). As such, some applications prefer to use a "stop" icon instead of a "pause" when
dealing with the live streams.

Another difference is that a live stream cannot be "seeked" and
most likely doesnâ€™t have a duration. CCL provides mechanisms for application developers to
handle these. First, one has to set the correct stream type on a media item so that CCL can
recognize it as a live stream:

```java
MediaInfo.Builder(url).setStreamType(MediaInfo.STREAM_TYPE_LIVE)....
```

For media items with the above stream type, CCL automatically uses a "stop" icon instead of a
"pause" icon in all relevant places, e.g.:
- Mini Controllers
- Notifications
- Lock Screen
- Media Router Controller Dialog
- `VideoCastControllerActivity`

In addition, the `VideoCastControllerActivity` hides the seekbar and the duration for live streams.
There are two technical details that you need to be aware of:

1. For live streams, when user presses the "stop" button, the CCL library still sends
the same "pause" command to the receiver. The reason for this is two-fold:
	1. The receiver needs to provide its custom logic for handling this functionality so
  it can interpret the "pause" command based on the type of media accordingly.
  2. The standard "stop" command has a special functionality associated with it.
  For example, it unloads the media, which is not the desired behavior for live streams.

2. When a live stream is "stopped", the receiver **must** send a media status update
message back to the sender and should report the state as `MediaStatus.PLAYER_STATE_IDLE`
with the reason `MediaStatus.IDLE_REASON_CANCELED`.
For live streams, the CCL library will interpret this status appropriately.

#### Reconnection

One of the parameters that the Reconnection logic uses to control its behavior is the duration of
the media that is playing on the cast device. When we are dealing with a live stream, there is no
clear duration so the library uses a default value of "2 hrs". This, however, can be changed if
needed. Call `VideoCastManager.setLiveStreamDuration(duration)` where duration is
specified in milliseconds.

### Obtaining Authorization prior to playback

There are situations where an application needs to authorize a user before it allows the
playback of a content. The CCL library has certain hooks and mechanisms in place to help with
this process. Here is a list of steps:

1. Client applications need to provide an implementation of `MediaAuthService`. The
implementation is responsible for setting up the process internally but should not start
the authorization process till its `start()` method is called.

2. When ready, the client application needs to call the following library method and
pass the implementation of the interface to the framework:

```java
VideoCastManager.startCastControllerActivity(Context context, MediaAuthService authService);
```

3. Framework will build and pass an instance of `MediaAuthListener` to the
implementation; this listener interface provides two callback methods, `onAuthResult()`
and `onAuthFailure()`, using which, the implementation can communicate back with the
library when its work is done, or if it encounters an error.

4. Framework will start the `VideoCastControllerActivity` and at an appropriate
time calls the `start()` method of the `MediaAuthService` to start the authorization process.
It also calls the `getMediaInfo()` on that interface to get the current media information. It
is possible that at that point in the process, the `getMediaInfo()` returns a very limited
information since, for example, the URL to the media may not yet be available until the
authorization succeeds. The framework, however, expects to find the artwork assets in
that early `MediaInfo` object so it can provide a background image for the
`VideoCastControllerActivity` while the authorization process is happening. Note that
the implementation has to provide a timeout (obtained through
`MediaAuthService.getTimeout()`) so the framework can interrupt the process after a
reasonable period.

5. When the authorization process is finished, the implementation has to call the
`onAuthResult()` of the `MediaAuthListener` to inform the framework that the authorization
process is completed; the arguments passed to this method will determine if
authorization was granted or rejected. If the authorization process encounters an
unrecoverable error, it has to call the `onAuthFailure()` of the `MediaAuthListener` to
inform the framework.

### Supporting Configuration Changes in `VideoCastControllerActivity`

A client application may need to support different configurations for the
`VideoCastControllerActivity` and provide different layouts for each configuration, e.g.
both a landscape and a portrait layout. To provide continuity during the configuration changes
(especially if a pre-authorization or a normal load is happening), the framework uses a
[Fragment](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/Fragment.html)
(`VideoCastControllerFragment`) to maintain the state and to handle the work. This fragment
does not contribute any UI; the UI is completely handled by the `VideoCastControllerActivity`.

A common approach to customize the UI is to copy the layout resources from the library to your
project (layout is defined in `cast_activity.xml`) and modify the layout in your own project
(without changing the IDs of the components). This might not be as flexible as your application
needs, so the CCL library allows you to define your own activity and use the
`VideoCastControllerFragment` to manage the lifecycle and interaction with a cast device.
In order for that to work, your activity should implement `VideoCastController` interface
(`VideoCastControllerActivity` itself is an implementation of that interface).  Take a look at the
[`VideoCastControllerActivity`](https://github.com/googlecast/CastCompanionLibrary-android/blob/master/src/com/google/android/libraries/cast/companionlibrary/cast/player/VideoCastControllerActivity.java)
to see how the `VideoCastControllerFragment` needs to be called.

## Configuration and Setup

### Manifest file

Your `AndroidManifest.xml` file needs to include certain elements and metadata for the library
and Cast SDK proper operation. Here is a list of requirements:

- Minimum SDK version: the minimum SDK version that the library works with is 10 (GingerBread 2.3.3).

- Permissions: using the cast functionality does not require any additional
permissions. If, however, you have enabled Wifi Reconnection, then you need to add the
following two permissions:

	```xml
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
	```

- Application Metadata: like any application that uses the Play Services, add the
following metadata to your application declaration:

	```xml
	<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
		android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
	```

- Makes sure your applicationâ€™s "theme" is correctly set based on the min SDK
version. For example, you may need to use a variant of `Theme.AppCompat` or one that
inherits from these themes. Note that this is not a requirement for Cast, per se.

- Declare the `VideoCastControllerActivity`:

	```xml
	<activity
		android:name="com.google.sample.castcompanionlibrary.cast.player.VideoCastControllerActivity"
		android:screenOrientation="portrait"
		android:label="@string/app_name"
		android:launchMode="singleTask"
		android:parentActivityName="*MY_PARENT_ACTIVITY*"
		android:theme="*AN_OVERLAY_THEME*">
		<meta-data
			android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
			android:value="*MY_PARENT_ACTIVITY*" />
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
		</intent-filter>
	</activity>
	```

	There are a few things that you need to set in the above snippet. If the user clicks
	on your applicationâ€™s notification from the status bar while casting, the desired behavior
	is to open your application and to the `VideoCastControllerActivity`.
	However, this is not the main launcher activity of your application, so if the user were to
	press the back button, your application would close. Instead, we want to send the user to
	the parent activity -- the one that would show up when user clicks back from the
	`VideoCastControllerActivity` in a normal execution of your application.

	This special behavior can be achieved by creating a "back stack" for the PendingIntent in
	the notification service. CCL can handle this for you if you declare the correct parent
	activity in the manifest. You need to enter the name of that activity (possibly a fully
	qualified name) in place of `*PARENT_ACTIVITY*` in the above snippet.

	In addition, the `VideoCastControllerActivity` is best presented if you use an overlay
	Action Bar theme. The CastVideos reference app defines one
  ([CastVideosTheme](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android/blob/7b03dc792db141d11a72bf4a30eb9c062418ed86/res/values/styles_castvideo.xml))
	that you can copy and use, or you can define your own theme. Your theme should replace the
	`*AN_OVERLAY_THEME*` in the above snippet.

- Declare the following receiver:

	```xml
	<receiver
		android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.remotecontrol.VideoIntentReceiver" >
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="android.media.AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY" />
			<action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
			<action android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.action.toggleplayback" />
			<action android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.action.stop" />
		</intent-filter>
	</receiver>
	```

	This receiver is called when user interacts with the `VideoCastNotificationService` or
	`RemoteControlClient``; each of these components broadcast a message that this receiver
	catches and handles appropriately.

- Declare the following service (for `VideoCastNotificationService`):

	```xml
	<service
		android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.notification.VideoCastNotificationService"
		android:exported="false" >
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.action.notificationvisibility" />
		</intent-filter>
	</service>
	```

- Declare the following service (for `ReconnectionService`) if Wifi Reconnection has been enabled:

	```xml
	<service android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.cast.reconnection.ReconnectionService"/>
	```

- If you want to enable Captions in the preferences, declare the following activity in your manifest:

	```xml
	<activity
		android:name="com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.cast.tracks.CaptionsPreferenceActivity"
		android:label="@string/action_settings" >
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
		</intent-filter>
	</activity>
	```
